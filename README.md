## Features

- **Playlist Generation with Pathways Language Model**: The project leverages Google's Pathways Language Model to generate playlists based on natural language requests. This allows you to interact with the music player using conversational prompts to curate playlists tailored to your preferences.

- **Modern React Frontend**: The frontend of Apollo Music is built using the React framework. The user interface is designed for a seamless and engaging music discovery experience.

- **Custom Python Backend**: The project utilizes a custom backend written in Python. This backend is responsible for fetching playlists generated by the language model and preparing them for streaming. Check it out here: [AI Playlist API](https://github.com/MitchellZ/Playlist-AI-API).

- **Dynamic Styling and Cover Art Integration**: Apollo Music boasts a modern design that dynamically responds to the cover art of each track. The cover art, sourced from Last.fm, enriches the visual aspect of the music player.

- **Streaming Capability**: The music player allows you to stream songs directly from the playlists generated by the backend. This feature ensures a hassle-free playback experience.
  
- **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Apollo Music incorporates some progressive web app functionality, enabling you to install it on your device. This offers a convenient way to access your favorite playlists on the go.

- **Media Session API Integration**: The project integrates with the Media Session API, enabling external controls from browsers and Bluetooth devices. This provides you with enhanced control over playback even when the app is running in the background.
